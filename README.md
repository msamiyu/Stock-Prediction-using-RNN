# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-RNN
## Overview

In this work, we carry out a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future price of stock. This project predicts the stock price of the JP Morgan Chase and Co. Inc based on the stock price datasets from 2010 to June, 2019. The profit or loss calculation is determined by the closing price of a stock for the day. The adjusted closed price (almost exactly the same as the stock price) is used for this project. The method used is the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the tensorflow in python script.

## Motivation/Goal

One of the most challenging tasks is predicting the stock price. This is because the it involves so many rational and irrational behaviour which makes it very difficult to predict with large number of accuracies. A successful and accurate prediction of stock price will definitely yield significant profit. Many argued that predicting the future value of stock is unpredictable while others disagree. Machine learning algorithms have the accuracy potential for predictions. With the machine learning techniques, an unseen pattern could be accurately predicted. This project implemented machine learning algorithm using the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the tensorflow in python. A recurrent neural network is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. It is an example of regression under supervised learning.
